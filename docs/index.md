# Overview

CodeSee creates customizable and extensible architecture diagrams of your codebase. Codebase Maps support Go, Java, Javascript, Python, Typescript and will soon be compatible with more languages. In addition, whenever you make a pull request on a repository, a Review Map will automatically generate.

## Privacy 

CodeSee Maps uses GitHub to generate dependencies between files and updates your map to reflect changes in your codebase. We don't store your code, we analyze it on GitHub's servers using a GitHub Action.

By default, CodeSee auto-updates to new versions and collects usage data and crash report information. You may opt-out of these defaults by sending an email to [support@codesee.io](mailto:support@codesee.io).

CodeSee is in beta. Please contact us at [support@codesee.io](mailto:support@codesee.io) with support questions, feedback, or feature requests.
