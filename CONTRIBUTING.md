# Contributing to CodeSee's documentation

We welcome community contributions to our documentation.

Before you start, please review our [Code of Conduct](TODO: link), and our [Style Guide](https://github.com/Codesee-io/docs/wiki/Style-guide).

## For the CodeSee team

CodeSee team members can contribute directly to the docs repo.

1. Follow the quickstart in the README to get set up with the docs tooling.
2. Create a new branch for your work. Try to use a fresh branch for each task or chunk of work:
    ```
    git branch -b branchName
    ```
3. Add it to GitHub:
    ```
    git add *
    git commit -m "message describing your changes"
    # first commit
    git push --set-upstream origin branchName
    # subsequently
    git push
    ```
4. When your work is ready, submit a pull request. You will need at least one approved review before you can merge your changes.

## For outside contributors

You will need to fork the repo. Make all changes on a branch, not on main. When you are ready, submit a pull request to merge your branch back into CodeSee's main.
